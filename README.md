ðŸ“ŠProject-1: NBA Player Analysis ðŸ“Š

ðŸ”ŽProblem Statement: 
The NBA Player Analysis Dashboard provides a detailed examination of player performance metrics and physical attributes across multiple NBA seasons. This report delves into the data visualized in the dashboard, offering insights into how factors such as sprint speed, wingspan, weight, and agility contribute to player success and draft selection. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover trends, highlight standout performers, and present a clear picture of the physical and performance-related characteristics that have shaped the careers of NBA players over the years.

ðŸ“¶ Project Steps:

ðŸ”¹ Data Collection: Gather NBA Draft Combine measurement data.

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning: Clean the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Analysis: Use data analytics tools (like Python, R, or Excel) to:

 - Identify trends and patterns in player measurements.
 
 - Analyze correlations between measurements and player performance.

ðŸ”¹ Visualization: Create visual reports to present your findings.

ðŸ“ŠProject Analysis Overview:

ðŸ”¹ The data set contains 517 rows and 19 columns

ðŸ”¹ This data set contains both numerical(18) and categorical columns(1)

ðŸ”¹ Among those there are some missing values present in data. Those are filled with"mode".

ðŸ”¹ Categorical column analysis done by using value counts function.

ðŸ”¹ Numerical Column analysis done by using Histogram.

ðŸ”¹ Analysis used predefined function 'describe', to extract mean,mode, minimum value, maximum value, standard deviation, 25percentile, 50percentile, 75 percentile , Count of Numerical data.

ðŸ”¹ Outlier analysis : using box plot

ðŸ”¹ Removed outliers with: IQR(Inter Quartile Range) Technique.



PROJECT-2:ðŸ’«BIG GAME CENSUS DATA VISUALIZATIONðŸ’«


 ðŸ”ŽProject Overview: 
You will be responsible for creating a Big Game Census Data Visualization. The goal is to analyse and visualize census data related to big game populations and trends, providing clear insights for decision-making.

ðŸ“¶ Project Steps:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
 - Gather the census data related to various species of big game, population counts, geographic distribution, and trends over time.

 - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure itâ€™s ready for analysis and visualization.
   
2. Data Analysis:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, correlations, and key insights from the dataset.
   
 - Use statistical techniques to interpret the data and derive meaningful insights related to species population trends, habitat changes, and migration patter

3. Data Visualization:
 - Create visually appealing and informative dashboards or reports using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).
   
 - Ensure the visualizations are clear, interactive, and provide key insights at a glance for decision-makers.
